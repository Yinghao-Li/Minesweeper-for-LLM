--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1" to "8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1" to "8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING:
At the start of the game, there is no information available to make an informed decision about where the mines are located. Therefore, the best strategy is to start from the center of the board, as it will provide the most information about the surrounding cells.

L(3,3)

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING:
The cells at (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) are numbered, indicating that they are adjacent to mines. The cell at (4,4) has the highest number, 3, which means it is adjacent to 3 mines. Since there are only 3 unopened cells adjacent to it, we can safely assume that all these cells are mines. Therefore, we should flag these cells.

Continuing from the previous reasoning, the other two unopened cells adjacent to the cell at (4,4) are also mines. Therefore, we should flag these cells as well.

Continuing from the previous reasoning, the last unopened cell adjacent to the cell at (4,4) is also a mine. Therefore, we should flag this cell as well.

ACTION:
R(4,5)

>> USER:
Your previous action "R(4,5)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').
Please follow the instructions and try again.

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING:
My apologies for the previous mistake. The cell at (4,5) is already a numbered cell, not an unopened cell. The last unopened cell adjacent to the cell at (4,4) is at (5,5). Therefore, we should flag this cell as it is also a mine.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING:
Now that we have flagged all the mines around the cell at (4,4), we can safely open the remaining unopened cells around the cells at (4,2) and (4,3) as they indicate that there are 2 mines around them and we have already flagged those mines.

ACTION:
L(4,1)

  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: R(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: M(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Error: No flagged cells detected nearby. Flag adjacent mines before middle-clicking.\n[Action 4]: ACTION: L(3,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: R(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 6]: ACTION: R(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 7]: ACTION: R(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 8]: ACTION: R(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 9]: ACTION: R(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`1',`.',`2',`?'\n\"4\",`?',`1',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`?',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

    "\nREASONING: Since the board is completely empty, there is no information to base any decisions on. Therefore, the best course of action is to start by opening the center cell at (3,3) with a left-click. This will reveal the number of mines in its neighboring cells, giving us some information to work with.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "\nREASONING: The cell at (3,3) displays a `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 6 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)",
    "\nREASONING: The cell at (2,2) displays a `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 3 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (1,1). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (1,1) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (1,1) with a right-click. However, we cannot do so as the cell is already opened. Therefore, we need to use a middle-click on (2,2) to unveil its neighboring cells, which will automatically open all adjacent cells since all mines have been correctly flagged.\n\nACTION: M(2,2)",
    "\nREASONING: The cell at (2,2) displays a `1', indicating that there is a single mine in its neighboring cells. Examining the cells adjacent to it, we see that (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) are all opened as empty or numbered cells. This means that there are no mines in these cells, and the remaining unopened cells are (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5). Out of these cells, only (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4) are adjacent to (2,2). Since (1,4) and (2,4) are already opened, the only unopened cell adjacent to (2,2) is (3,4). Therefore, we can safely open (3,4) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(3,4)",

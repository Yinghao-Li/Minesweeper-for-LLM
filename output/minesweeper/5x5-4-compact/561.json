  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: R(1,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 3]: ACTION: L(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 4]: ACTION: R(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 6]: ACTION: R(1,2) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 7]: ACTION: R(3,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 8]: ACTION: L(3,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`F',`F',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`2',`2',`2',`1'\n\"3\",`1',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will start by randomly selecting a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are several cells with numbers indicating the number of adjacent mines. The cell at (2,2) has a number `2', which means there are two mines in its neighboring cells. The cells at (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1) are already opened and do not contain any mines. Therefore, the remaining unopened cells at (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), and (3,2) must contain the two mines. \n\nACTION:\nTo proceed, I will flag the cells at (1,3) and (1,4) as potential mine locations.\n\nACTION: R(1,3), R(1,4)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,3) is surrounded by two flagged cells, indicating that both of its neighboring mines have been correctly identified. Therefore, we can safely open the cell at (2,3) by left-clicking on it.\n\nACTION:\nL(2,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the eight neighboring cells, only three are flagged with `F'. This means that there are still two unflagged cells that could potentially contain mines. \n\nNext, we can observe the cell at (3,4), which is also numbered `2'. Among its eight neighboring cells, only two are flagged with `F'. This implies that there are two unflagged cells that could potentially contain mines.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the unopened cells at (2,3) and (3,3) are the potential mine locations. \n\nACTION:\nTo proceed, I will flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the eight neighboring cells, only three are opened, and one of them is flagged. This means that there are still four unopened cells adjacent to (2,2) that could potentially contain mines. \n\nNext, we can observe that the cell at (3,3) is numbered `.', indicating that it has no neighboring mines. Since all the cells adjacent to (3,3) are already opened, we can safely left-click on (3,3) to reveal it.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the eight neighboring cells, only three are opened, and one of them is flagged. This means that there are still four unopened cells adjacent to (2,2) that could potentially contain mines. \n\nNext, let's analyze the cell at (1,3), which is flagged with `F'. This suggests that there is a mine in one of its neighboring cells. Since (1,3) is adjacent to (2,2), it is possible that one of the unopened cells adjacent to (2,2) is a mine. \n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that the unopened cell at (1,2) is a potential mine. Therefore, our next move should be to flag the cell at (1,2) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(1,2)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are two flagged cells adjacent to the cell at (2,2). This means that out of the three neighboring cells, two of them are mines. Since the cell at (2,2) is labeled with a `2', it indicates that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Therefore, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (3,2) contains a mine.\n\nACTION:\nR(3,2)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are two flagged cells adjacent to the cell at (2,2), which is numbered as `2'. This means that both of the neighboring cells contain mines. Therefore, we can safely conclude that the remaining unopened cell adjacent to (2,2), which is at (3,2), does not contain a mine. We can proceed to left-click on that cell to reveal its content.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,2)"

  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: R(1,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 3]: ACTION: L(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell.

The neighboring cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2). Out of these cells, (1,1) and (1,2) are already opened, and (2,2) is flagged.

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will start by randomly selecting a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are several cells with numbers indicating the number of adjacent mines. The cell at (2,2) has a number `2', which means there are two mines in its neighboring cells. \n\nTo determine the location of these mines, we need to consider the surrounding cells. The cell at (1,1) is unopened and adjacent to (2,2), so it could potentially contain a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) is also unopened and adjacent to (2,2). \n\nHowever, the cell at (1,3) is already opened and does not have a mine, so we can conclude that the mines are not in the cells (1,1) or (1,2). Therefore, the unopened cell at (1,3) must contain a mine.\n\nACTION:\nR(1,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,3) is surrounded by two flagged cells, indicating that both of its neighboring mines have been correctly identified. Therefore, we can safely open the cell at (2,3) by left-clicking on it.\n\nACTION:\nL(2,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the eight neighboring cells, only three are flagged with `F'. This means that there are still two unflagged cells that may contain mines. \n\nNext, we can observe the cell at (3,2), which is numbered `1'. This suggests that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among the eight neighboring cells, only two are flagged with `F'. Therefore, there is one unflagged cell that may contain a mine.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the unflagged cell at (4,2) is a potential mine. To confirm this, we can left-click on this cell to reveal its content.\n\nACTION: L(4,2)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the eight neighboring cells, only three are opened, which means there are still five unopened cells. Since there are two mines, we can deduce that three of the unopened cells contain mines. \n\nNext, let's examine the cell at (3,2), which is numbered `1'. This means there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Out of the eight neighboring cells, only two are opened, so there are still six unopened cells. Since there is one mine, we can deduce that five of the unopened cells are safe.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the unopened cells at (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1) are safe. We can safely open these cells with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,1), L(2,3), L(3,1), L(4,1), L(5,1)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,1) is numbered `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The neighboring cells of (2,1) are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1). Out of these cells, (1,1) and (1,2) are already opened, and (1,3) is flagged. This means that the mine must be in either (2,2) or (3,1). \n\nACTION:\nTo proceed, we can safely open the cell at (2,2) by left-clicking on it.\n\nACTION: L(2,2)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,1) is numbered `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, the cells at (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2) are already opened, and the cell at (3,1) is flagged. This means that the remaining unopened cell at (3,2) must contain the mine. Therefore, we should flag the cell at (3,2) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(3,2)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,1) is numbered `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, the cells at (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2) are already opened, leaving only the cell at (3,1) unopened. Since there is only one adjacent mine, it is logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (3,1) contains the mine.\n\nACTION: R(3,1)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are several numbered cells and flagged cells. The numbered cells indicate the number of mines in their neighboring cells, while the flagged cells indicate potential mine locations. \n\nBased on the information provided, we can make the following observations:\n1. The cell at (2,1) is opened and displays the number `1'. This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells.\n2. The cell at (2,2) is opened and displays the number `2'. This means that there are two mines in its neighboring cells.\n3. The cell at (2,3) is opened and displays the number `2'. This means that there are two mines in its neighboring cells.\n4. The cell at (2,4) is opened and displays the number `2'. This means that there are two mines in its neighboring cells.\n5. The cell at (2,5) is opened and displays the number `1'. This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells.\n6. The cell at (3,1) is flagged, indicating a potential mine location.\n7. The cell at (3,2) is opened and displays the number `1'. This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells.\n8. The cell at (4,2) is opened and displays the number `2'. This means that there are two mines in its neighboring cells.\n9. The cell at (4,3) is opened and displays the number `1'. This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells.\n10. The cell at (5,3) is opened and displays the number `1'. This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells.\n\nBased on these observations, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (3,3) is safe to open because it is not adjacent to any numbered cells and does not have any flagged cells nearby.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,1) is numbered `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The neighboring cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2). Out of these cells, (1,1) and (1,2) are already opened, and (2,2) is flagged.

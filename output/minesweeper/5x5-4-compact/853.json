  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 4]: ACTION: R(2,1) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 5]: ACTION: L(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 6]: ACTION: R(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 7]: ACTION: R(4,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 8]: ACTION: R(3,1) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 9]: ACTION: L(3,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`1',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`F',`2',`1',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`?',`1',`2',`2',`1'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will start by randomly selecting a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are several unopened cells surrounding the numbered cells. The cell at (3,3) is currently unopened and has a neighboring cell with the number `1'. This indicates that there is one mine adjacent to the cell at (3,3). \n\nBy opening the cell at (3,3), we can gather more information about the surrounding cells and potentially uncover more safe cells. \n\nACTION:\nL(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are several unopened cells surrounding the numbered cells. The cell at (3,3) is a blank cell, indicating that there are no mines in its neighboring cells. Therefore, it is safe to open this cell.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that there are several cells with numbers indicating the number of adjacent mines. The cell at (2,2) has a number `2', which means there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, (1,1) and (1,3) are already opened, so they cannot contain mines. This leaves us with two unopened cells, (2,1) and (2,3), one of which must contain a mine. \n\nACTION:\nTo proceed, I will flag one of the unopened cells, either (2,1) or (2,3), as a potential mine. This will help me keep track of the remaining mines and avoid accidentally opening a mine. I will choose to flag the cell at (2,1) by right-clicking on it.\n\nACTION: R(2,1)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,1) is flagged with an 'F', indicating that it is a potential mine. The cell at (2,2) is numbered '2', which means it has 2 adjacent mines. Since there is already one mine accounted for in the flagged cell at (2,1), we can deduce that the remaining mine must be in one of the adjacent cells to (2,2). \n\nACTION:\nTo uncover the remaining mine, we can left-click on the cell at (2,3) since it is the only unopened cell adjacent to (2,2).\n\nACTION: L(2,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,1) is flagged with an 'F', indicating that it is a potential mine. The cell at (2,2) is numbered '2', which means it has 2 adjacent mines. Since there is already one flagged mine adjacent to it, there must be one more mine in the neighboring cells. Therefore, we can conclude that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the remaining mine.\n\nACTION:\nR(2,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, only one is flagged with `F', which means that there is still one unflagged mine adjacent to (2,2). \n\nAdditionally, the cell at (3,2) is numbered `1', suggesting that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, only one cell remains unopened at (4,2). Since there is only one adjacent mine, it is logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (4,2) contains the mine.\n\nACTION:\nR(4,2)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, only one is flagged with `F', which means there is still one unflagged mine. Therefore, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (3,1) contains the remaining mine.\n\nACTION: R(3,1)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, only one mine has been flagged at (3,1). Therefore, the remaining unopened cell at (3,2) must contain the second mine. To progress, we should left-click on (3,2) to reveal its content.\n\nACTION: L(3,2)",

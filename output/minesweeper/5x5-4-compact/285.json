The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: R(4,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 4]: ACTION: M(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot middle-click a blank cell.

Among these neighbors, the cells at (1,2) and (2,2) are already flagged with `F', suggesting that they contain mines. Therefore, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (1,3) is mine-free.\n\nACTION: L(1,3)\n\n",

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will start by randomly selecting a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is a numbered cell with a value of `.'. This means that there are no mines in its neighboring cells. Additionally, all the cells adjacent to (3,3) are unopened. Therefore, it is safe to left-click on the cell at (3,3) to reveal it.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that there are several numbered cells indicating the number of adjacent mines. The cell at (2,2) has a number `3', which means there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells. Out of these neighboring cells, only one is flagged with an `F' at (1,3). This suggests that there are still 2 unflagged mines adjacent to (2,2). \n\nAdditionally, the cell at (3,2) has a number `2', indicating there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, only one is flagged with an `F' at (4,2). This means there is still 1 unflagged mine adjacent to (3,2).\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (4,3) is a mine, as it is adjacent to both (2,2) and (3,2), which have a total of 3 mines between them. Therefore, our next move is to flag the cell at (4,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(4,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is a blank cell, indicating that it has no neighboring mines. Since it is surrounded by numbered cells, we can deduce that all of its neighboring cells are safe to open. \n\nACTION: M(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `3', indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. Out of these neighboring cells, only one is flagged with `F' at (3,1). This means that there are two remaining unopened cells adjacent to (2,2) that potentially contain mines. \n\nACTION: To proceed, we should middle-click on cell (2,2) to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged.",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that there are several numbered cells with adjacent unopened cells. Let's analyze them one by one:\n\n1. The cell at (2,2) is a `3', indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four adjacent unopened cells, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3), we can deduce that at least one of them contains a mine. However, since there are three mines in total, we can't determine which specific cells contain the mines.\n\n2. The cell at (2,3) is a `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among the four adjacent unopened cells, (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,4), we can deduce that one of them contains the mine. However, we can't determine which specific cell contains the mine.\n\n3. The cell at (3,2) is a `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four adjacent unopened cells, (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), and (3,3), we can deduce that two of them contain mines. However, we can't determine which specific cells contain the mines.\n\nBased on this analysis, we don't have enough information to make a definitive move. We need to gather more information by opening other cells or flagging potential mine locations.\n\nACTION: L(1,1)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `3', indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. Out of these neighboring cells, only one is flagged with `F' at (1,3). This means that there are two remaining mines in the adjacent cells. \n\nNext, we can observe that the cell at (3,2) is numbered `2', suggesting that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, only one is flagged with `F' at (2,1). Therefore, there is one remaining mine in the adjacent cells.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (2,2) contains one of the remaining mines. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,2) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,2)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `3', indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. Out of these neighboring cells, only one is flagged with `F', which means there are still two unflagged mines. Therefore, it is not safe to middle-click on the cell at (2,2) yet.\n\nACTION: R(1,2)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `3', indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. Out of these neighbors, only one mine has been flagged at (1,2). Therefore, there are two remaining unflagged mines adjacent to (2,2). \n\nACTION: R(2,1)\n\nThis action will flag the cell at (2,1) as a potential mine, as it is one of the two remaining unflagged cells adjacent to (2,2).",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,3) is numbered `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, the cells at (1,2) and (2,2) are already flagged with `F', suggesting that they contain mines. Therefore, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (1,3) is mine-free.\n\nACTION: L(1,3)"

  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: L(1,1) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 3]: ACTION: R(5,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 4]: ACTION: R(4,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: L(4,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 6]: ACTION: R(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 7]: ACTION: R(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 8]: ACTION: R(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 9]: ACTION: R(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`?',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`?',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`?',`2',`1',`2',`1'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`F',`?',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

The neighboring cells are (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2). Out of these three cells, (2,1) and (2,2) are already opened, so the mine must be in cell (1,2).

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will randomly select a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that all the cells in the first row and column are unopened. Since these cells have no neighboring cells, they are safe to open without any risk of hitting a mine. Opening these cells will give us more information about the surrounding cells.\n\nACTION: L(1,1)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is already opened and it displays the number `1'. This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. \n\nNext, we can observe that the cell at (4,3) is also opened and it displays the number `2'. This indicates that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. \n\nConsidering these two pieces of information, we can deduce that one of the mines must be in the cell at (5,3), as it is the only unopened cell adjacent to both (3,3) and (4,3). Therefore, our next move should be to flag the cell at (5,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(5,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (4,3) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, only one mine has been flagged at (5,3). Therefore, there is still one unflagged mine adjacent to (4,3). \n\nACTION:\nTo progress in the game, we should flag the cell at (4,3) to indicate the presence of a mine.\n\nACTION: R(4,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is numbered `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells.

The neighboring cells are (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2). Out of these three cells, (1,2) and (2,1) are already opened, so the remaining unopened cell at (2,2) must contain the mine. Therefore, we can flag the cell at (2,2) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,2)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The neighboring cells of (2,2) are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Out of these, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2) are already opened or flagged, leaving only (2,3) and (3,3) unopened. Since there is only one mine, we can deduce that the mine must be in one of these two cells. \n\nACTION: R(2,3)",

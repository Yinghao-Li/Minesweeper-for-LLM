  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: L(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: R(5,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 4]: ACTION: L(4,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: L(3,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 6]: ACTION: R(5,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 7]: ACTION: L(1,1) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 8]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 9]: ACTION: R(4,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`1',`1',`.',`1',`1'\n\"4\",`?',`3',`1',`1',`?'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

The cell at (3,3) has a `1' indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The cell at (4,3) has a `3' indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. Since there are three unopened cells adjacent to (4,3), it is likely that all three of them contain mines.

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will start by randomly selecting a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is already opened and displays the number `1'. This indicates that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. \n\nExamining the surrounding cells, we can see that the cells at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) are all unopened. Since there is only one mine in the neighboring cells, we can deduce that one of these unopened cells contains the mine.\n\nACTION:\nTo proceed, I will left-click on the cell at (2,2) to reveal its content.\n\nACTION: L(2,2)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are two numbered cells with adjacent unopened cells. The cell at (3,3) is surrounded by blank cells, indicating that it is safe to open. Additionally, the cell at (4,3) has a number 1, suggesting that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, the cell at (5,3) is unopened, making it a potential mine location. Therefore, we should flag the cell at (5,3) to indicate that it contains a mine.\n\nACTION: R(5,3)",

The cell at (3,3) has a `1', indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The cell at (4,3) has a `3', indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. \n\nConsidering the information provided by these numbered cells, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (5,3) must contain a mine. This is because the cell at (4,3) already has three mines in its neighboring cells, and the cell at (3,3) has one mine in its neighboring cells. Therefore, the remaining mine must be in the unopened cell at (5,3).\n\nACTION:\nR(5,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are several numbered cells and some unopened cells. The numbered cells indicate the number of mines in their neighboring cells. \n\nThe cell at (3,3) is a blank cell, so we cannot left-click on it. \n\nThe cell at (2,2) is also a blank cell, so we cannot left-click on it either. \n\nThe cell at (5,3) has been flagged, so we cannot right-click on it again. \n\nThe cell at (4,3) is a numbered cell, so we cannot left-click on it. \n\nThe cell at (3,2) is also a numbered cell, so we cannot left-click on it. \n\nThe cell at (5,3) has already been flagged, so we cannot right-click on it again. \n\nBased on the current board, we need to find a cell that we can left-click on to reveal its contents.\n\nACTION:\nL(1,1)",

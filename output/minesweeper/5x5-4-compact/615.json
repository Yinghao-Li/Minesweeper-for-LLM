  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: L(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: L(4,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 4]: ACTION: R(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: L(1,1) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 6]: ACTION: L(2,1) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 7]: ACTION: R(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 8]: ACTION: R(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 9]: ACTION: L(2,1) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`1',`?',`1',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`2',`2',`1',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`?',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`?',`2',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`?',`1',`.',`1',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

The neighboring cells are (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2). Out of these three cells, (1,2) and (2,1) are already opened, so the remaining unopened cell at (2,2) must contain the mine.

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will start by randomly selecting a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is a numbered cell with a value of `2'. This means that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. \n\nIf we examine the cells adjacent to (3,3), we can see that (2,2) and (2,4) are both unopened cells. Since there are two mines in the neighboring cells, it is likely that one of these unopened cells contains a mine. \n\nACTION:\nTo gather more information and potentially uncover a safe cell, I will left-click on the cell at (2,2).\n\nACTION: L(2,2)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is a numbered cell with a value of `2'. This means that there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells. The neighboring cells of (3,3) are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4). Out of these 8 cells, only 3 are opened, which are (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). Since there are still 2 unopened cells among the neighboring cells, it is not possible to determine the exact location of the mines. Therefore, we need to gather more information by opening another cell.\n\nACTION:\nL(4,4)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that there are several numbered cells. The cell at (2,2) is a `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. However, we cannot left-click on a numbered cell, so we need to find another cell to open.\n\nThe cell at (1,3) is a `1', suggesting that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. We can deduce that the mine is either at (2,2) or (2,3). Since we already know that (2,2) is a numbered cell, it is more likely that the mine is at (2,3). Therefore, we should flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that there are several cells with numbers indicating the number of adjacent mines. The cell at (2,2) has a number `2', which means there are two mines in its neighboring cells. However, the cell at (1,1) is still unopened and could potentially be one of the mines. To confirm this, we need to open the cell at (1,1) and see if it reveals a mine or a number.\n\nACTION:\nL(1,1)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are several numbered cells indicating the number of adjacent mines. The cell at (1,1) is a `1', which means there is one mine adjacent to it. The neighboring cells at (2,1) and (2,2) are still unopened, so one of them must contain the mine. \n\nACTION:\nTo progress in the game, I will left-click on the cell at (2,1) to reveal its content.\n\nACTION: L(2,1)",

The neighboring cells of (1,1) are (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2). Out of these three cells, (1,2) and (2,1) are already opened, so the remaining unopened cell, (2,2), must contain the mine.

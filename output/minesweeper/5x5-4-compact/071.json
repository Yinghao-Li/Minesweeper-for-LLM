The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: L(2,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: R(1,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 4]: ACTION: L(3,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: R(1,2) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 6]: ACTION: R(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 7]: ACTION: R(1,4) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 8]: ACTION: R(1,5) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 9]: ACTION: R(3,5) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`F',`F',`F',`F'\n\"2\",`1',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`2',`F'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words.\n\nREASONING:\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\nREASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,5) is a numbered cell with a value of `3'. This means that there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the 8 neighboring cells, 5 are already opened or flagged, leaving 3 unopened cells. Since there are exactly 3 mines in the neighboring cells, we can deduce that all 3 unopened cells contain mines. Therefore, we can safely flag all 3 unopened cells.\n\nACTION: R(2,4), R(2,5), R(2,6)\n\n",

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will start by randomly selecting a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,4) is labeled with the number `3', indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. Out of these neighboring cells, only one is already opened, which is the cell at (3,4). Since there are still two unopened cells adjacent to (2,4), it is likely that one of them contains a mine. \n\nACTION:\nTo proceed, I will left-click on the cell at (2,4) to reveal its content.\n\nACTION: L(2,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,4) is a numbered cell with a value of `3'. This means that there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells. However, the cell at (1,3) is still unopened, and it is adjacent to the cell at (2,4). Since there are 3 mines in the neighboring cells of (2,4), and only one unopened cell adjacent to it, it is highly likely that the unopened cell at (1,3) contains a mine.\n\nACTION: R(1,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,3) is flagged with an 'F', indicating that it is a potential mine. The cell at (2,4) is numbered '1', which means there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among the neighboring cells, the cell at (1,3) is already flagged as a mine, so we can deduce that the mine must be in the cell at (3,4). Therefore, we can safely left-click on the cell at (3,4) to reveal it.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,3) is flagged with an 'F', indicating that it is a potential mine. The cell at (2,4) is numbered '3', which means there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells. Out of these neighboring cells, only one is flagged as a potential mine, so there are still 2 unopened cells that could potentially contain mines. Since the number of adjacent mines is equal to the number of unopened cells, we can safely conclude that both of these unopened cells are mines. Therefore, our next move should be to flag both of these cells.\n\nACTION: R(1,2), R(1,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,4) is numbered `3', indicating that there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells. Out of these neighboring cells, only one is flagged with an `F' at (1,3). This means that there are still 2 unflagged mines in the adjacent cells. Since we need to correctly flag all adjacent mines before middle-clicking on a numbered cell, our next move should be to flag the remaining mines. \n\nACTION: R(2,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,4) is a numbered cell with a value of `3'. This means that there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells.

  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: R(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 4]: ACTION: L(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: L(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 6]: ACTION: R(1,4) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 7]: ACTION: R(1,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 8]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 9]: ACTION: R(3,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`F',`F',`?'\n\"2\",`1',`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`2',`?'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`1',`1',`?'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

This means that there is exactly one mine in its neighboring cells. Among the neighboring cells, the cells at (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4) are already flagged with `F'. This indicates that all the mines neighboring the cell at (2,3) have been correctly flagged. Therefore, we can safely open the remaining neighboring cells by left-clicking on the cell at (2,3).\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n\n",

    "REASONING: Since the board is completely covered with unopened cells, there is no specific information available to make an informed decision about which cell to open first. Therefore, I will start by randomly selecting a cell to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is currently unopened and surrounded by numbered cells. The neighboring cells at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) are all numbered cells, indicating that there are mines in their adjacent cells. Since the cell at (3,3) is surrounded by mines, it is likely that it also contains a mine.\n\nACTION: R(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that there are several numbered cells indicating the number of adjacent mines. The cell at (3,3) is a blank cell, which means it has no adjacent mines. Therefore, we can safely open this cell.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the board, we can see that there are several numbered cells with adjacent unopened cells. The cell at (2,4) has a number `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the three adjacent unopened cells, (1,3), (2,3), and (3,3), two of them must contain mines. \n\nAdditionally, the cell at (4,4) also has a number `2', suggesting that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Among the four adjacent unopened cells, (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,3), two of them must contain mines.\n\nACTION:\nTo proceed, I will left-click on the cell at (2,3) to reveal its content.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that there are several numbered cells with adjacent unopened cells. The cell at (2,3) is a numbered cell with a value of `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the three adjacent unopened cells, one of them must contain a mine. \n\nACTION: To proceed, I will left-click on the cell at (2,3) to reveal its contents.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,4) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, only one is flagged with `F' at (1,3). This means that there is still one unflagged mine adjacent to (2,4). Therefore, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (1,4) contains the remaining mine.\n\nACTION: R(1,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,4) is a numbered cell with a value of `2'. This means that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the three neighboring cells, (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5), only (1,3) is unopened. Since there are two mines, it is likely that one of the mines is in the unopened cell at (1,3). Therefore, we should flag this cell as a potential mine.\n\nACTION: R(1,3)",
    "REASONING:\nLooking at the current board, we can see that there are several numbered cells and flagged cells. The numbered cells indicate the number of mines in their neighboring cells. The flagged cells indicate potential mine locations. \n\nBased on the information provided, we can make the following observations:\n1. The cell at (1,3) is flagged, indicating that it is a potential mine.\n2. The cell at (1,4) is also flagged, indicating that it is a potential mine.\n3. The cell at (2,4) is flagged, indicating that it is a potential mine.\n4. The cell at (3,4) is flagged, indicating that it is a potential mine.\n5. The cell at (4,4) is flagged, indicating that it is a potential mine.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that there are at least 5 mines in the neighboring cells of the numbered cell at (3,3). Therefore, it is safe to open the cell at (3,3) by left-clicking on it.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,4) is numbered `2', indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, only one is flagged with an `F' at (1,4). This means that there is still one unflagged mine adjacent to (2,4).

    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,3) is a numbered cell with a value of `1'. This means that there is exactly one mine in its neighboring cells. Among the neighboring cells, the cells at (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4) are already flagged with `F'. This indicates that all the mines neighboring the cell at (2,3) have been correctly flagged.

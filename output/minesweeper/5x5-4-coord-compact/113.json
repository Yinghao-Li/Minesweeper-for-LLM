The cells are presented as \"coordinate: state\" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by \"?\", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by \"1\" to \"8\", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by \".\", which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by \"F\", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to place a flag or a flagged cell (\"F\") to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (\"1\" to \"8\") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): .\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): ?\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): .\n(2,2): 1\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): .\n(3,2): 1\n(3,3): 2\n(3,4): 4\n(4,1): .\n(4,2): .\n(4,3): .\n(4,4): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number \"1\", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,4): .\n(1,5): 1\n(1,6): ?\n(1,7): ?\n(2,4): .\n(2,5): 1\n(2,6): F\n(2,7): ?\n(3,4): .\n(3,5): 1\n(3,6): 2\n(3,7): 4\n(4,4): .\n(4,5): .\n(4,6): .\n(4,7): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number \"1\", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with \"F\". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): 1\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): 2\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): ?\n(2,2): ?\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): ?\n(3,2): ?\n(3,3): ?\n(3,4): ?\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a \"1\", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: R(2,1) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 4]: ACTION: R(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell.

These numbered cells indicate the number of mines in their neighboring cells. By examining the surrounding cells of each numbered cell, we can deduce the locations of some mines. \n\nFirst, let's focus on the cell at (2,4), which is numbered as \"2\". This means that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. We can see that the cells at (1,3) and (3,4) are adjacent to (2,4) and are currently unopened. Since there are two mines, we can deduce that both (1,3) and (3,4) contain mines. Therefore, we can flag these cells.\n\nNext, let's consider the cell at (4,4), which is also numbered as \"2\". This means that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. We can see that the cells at (3,3) and (5,4) are adjacent to (4,4) and are currently unopened. Since there are two mines, we can deduce that both (3,3) and (5,4) contain mines. Therefore, we can flag these cells as well.\n\nACTION: R(1,3), R(3,4), R(3,3), R(5,4)\n\n",

    "REASONING: Since we are just starting the game, we have no information about the board. Therefore, we can choose any cell to open. To have a good starting point, let's select the center cell at (3, 3). By opening this cell, we will reveal some information about its neighboring cells.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is currently unopened and surrounded by numbered cells. The neighboring cells at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) are all numbered, indicating that there are mines in their adjacent cells. Since there are no other unopened cells adjacent to (3,3), it is safe to conclude that (3,3) does not contain a mine.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that there are three cells with the number \"1\" in the second row. This means that each of these cells has one mine in its neighboring cells. Since the cell at (2,3) is already opened and does not have a mine, we can deduce that the mine must be in either (2,1) or (2,2). \n\nACTION: To proceed, I will flag the cell at (2,1) with a right-click, as it is a potential mine location.\n\n",

Out of these neighboring cells, only (3,3) and (4,4) remain unopened. Since there are two mines, it is logical to deduce that both (3,3) and (4,4) contain mines.

    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,4) is a blank cell, indicating that there are no mines in its neighboring cells. Additionally, the cell at (4,4) is numbered \"1\", suggesting that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Since the cell at (3,4) is blank and has no mines nearby, we can safely left-click on it to reveal its contents.\n\nACTION: L(3,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that there are several numbered cells with adjacent blank cells. These numbered cells indicate the number of mines in their neighboring cells. For example, the cell at (2,4) has a \"2\" indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. \n\nTo determine the location of the mines, we can examine the adjacent blank cells. If all adjacent blank cells have been opened, we can safely conclude that there are no mines in those cells. In this case, the blank cells at (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), and (4,5) have all been opened, so we can deduce that there are no mines in those cells.\n\nACTION: Based on the reasoning above, I will left-click on the cell at (4,5) to open it.\n\nACTION: L(4,5)",

By examining the surrounding cells of each numbered cell, we can deduce the locations of some mines. \n\nIn this case, the cell at (2,4) is surrounded by four numbered cells, which means it must contain a mine.

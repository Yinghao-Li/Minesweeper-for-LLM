The cells are presented as \"coordinate: state\" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by \"?\", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by \"1\" to \"8\", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by \".\", which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by \"F\", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to place a flag or a flagged cell (\"F\") to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (\"1\" to \"8\") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): .\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): ?\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): .\n(2,2): 1\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): .\n(3,2): 1\n(3,3): 2\n(3,4): 4\n(4,1): .\n(4,2): .\n(4,3): .\n(4,4): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number \"1\", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,4): .\n(1,5): 1\n(1,6): ?\n(1,7): ?\n(2,4): .\n(2,5): 1\n(2,6): F\n(2,7): ?\n(3,4): .\n(3,5): 1\n(3,6): 2\n(3,7): 4\n(4,4): .\n(4,5): .\n(4,6): .\n(4,7): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number \"1\", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with \"F\". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): 1\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): 2\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): ?\n(2,2): ?\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): ?\n(3,2): ?\n(3,3): ?\n(3,4): ?\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a \"1\", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: R(4,5) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 3]: ACTION: R(3,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n[Action 4]: ACTION: L(4,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: L(3,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n(1,1): .\n(1,2): .\n(1,3): .\n(1,4): .\n(1,5): .\n(2,1): .\n(2,2): .\n(2,3): .\n(2,4): .\n(2,5): .\n(3,1): .\n(3,2): .\n(3,3): .\n(3,4): 1\n(3,5): 1\n(4,1): 1\n(4,2): 2\n(4,3): 2\n(4,4): 3\n(4,5): F\n(5,1): ?\n(5,2): ?\n(5,3): ?\n(5,4): ?\n(5,5): ?\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

This means that there is a mine adjacent to it. The cell at (4,4) has a number \"3\" indicating that there are 3 mines adjacent to it. Since one of those mines is already flagged at (4,5), we can deduce that the remaining two mines must be in the cells (5,3) and (5,4). Therefore, we can safely left-click on (5,3) to reveal it.\n\nACTION: L(5,3)\n\n",

    "REASONING: Since we are starting the game, there is no information available about the neighboring cells. Therefore, we can choose any cell to open. To start with, I will select the center cell at (3, 3) as it is a common starting point in Minesweeper.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (4,5) is currently unknown, and we need to determine whether it contains a mine or not. To make this determination, we can examine the neighboring cells. The cell at (3,4) is already opened and displays the number \"1\", indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The cell at (4,4) is also opened and displays the number \"3\", indicating that there are three mines in its neighboring cells. Since two of these mines are already accounted for in the neighboring cells (3,4) and (4,3), there must be one remaining mine in the neighboring cells of (4,5). Therefore, we can conclude that the cell at (4,5) contains a mine and should be flagged.\n\nACTION: R(4,5)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (4,5) is flagged as a potential mine. This means that there is a mine adjacent to it. The cell at (4,4) has a number \"3\" indicating that there are 3 mines in its neighboring cells. Since one of those mines is already flagged at (4,5), we can deduce that the other two mines must be in the cells adjacent to (4,4) that are still unopened. Therefore, the unopened cells at (3,4) and (4,3) are the remaining mines.\n\nACTION: R(3,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,4) is numbered \"1\" and has one adjacent mine. The neighboring cells are (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5). Out of these three cells, (4,5) is already flagged as a potential mine. Therefore, we can conclude that the mine is either at (4,3) or (4,4). \n\nACTION: To gather more information, I will left-click on cell (4,3) to reveal its content. \n\n",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (4,5) is flagged as a potential mine. The cell at (4,3) is numbered \"2\", indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the three neighboring cells, (3,4), (3,5), and (4,4), only (3,4) is unopened. Since there are two mines, it is likely that (3,4) contains one of them. Therefore, we can safely left-click on (3,4) to reveal its content.\n\nACTION: L(3,4)",

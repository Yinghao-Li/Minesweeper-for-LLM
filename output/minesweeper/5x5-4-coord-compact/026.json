  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as \"coordinate: state\" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by \"?\", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by \"1\" to \"8\", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by \".\", which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by \"F\", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to place a flag or a flagged cell (\"F\") to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (\"1\" to \"8\") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): .\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): ?\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): .\n(2,2): 1\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): .\n(3,2): 1\n(3,3): 2\n(3,4): 4\n(4,1): .\n(4,2): .\n(4,3): .\n(4,4): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number \"1\", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,4): .\n(1,5): 1\n(1,6): ?\n(1,7): ?\n(2,4): .\n(2,5): 1\n(2,6): F\n(2,7): ?\n(3,4): .\n(3,5): 1\n(3,6): 2\n(3,7): 4\n(4,4): .\n(4,5): .\n(4,6): .\n(4,7): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number \"1\", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with \"F\". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): 1\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): 2\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): ?\n(2,2): ?\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): ?\n(3,2): ?\n(3,3): ?\n(3,4): ?\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a \"1\", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: R(1,1) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 3]: ACTION: R(2,1) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 4]: ACTION: L(2,2) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell.

The cell at (1,2) has a number \"1\" indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Since (2,1) is flagged, we can deduce that the mine must be in either (2,2) or (2,3). \n\nACTION: Middle-click on cell (1,2) to unveil its neighboring cells.\n\n",

    "REASONING: Since we are starting the game, there is no information available about the neighboring cells. Therefore, we can choose any cell to open. To make the most informed decision, we can start by opening the center cell at (3, 3). This will give us some initial information about the surrounding cells.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered \"2\", indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3), only (1,1) and (3,1) are unopened. Since there are two mines, it is logical to deduce that both (1,1) and (3,1) contain mines. Therefore, we can safely flag these cells.\n\nACTION: R(1,1)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (1,2) is already opened and displays the number \"1\". This indicates that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among the neighboring cells, (2,1) and (2,2) are unopened. Since one mine has already been identified, it is safe to conclude that the mine is located at either (2,1) or (2,2). \n\nACTION: To proceed, I will flag one of the potential mine locations. I will place a flag on cell (2,1) with a right-click.\n\n",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (1,2) is already opened and displays the number \"1\". This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among the neighboring cells, the cell at (2,1) is flagged as a potential mine. Therefore, we can deduce that the mine is located in one of the remaining unopened cells adjacent to (1,2), which are (2,2) and (2,3). \n\nACTION: I will left-click on cell (2,2) to reveal its content.",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered \"2\", indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, (1,1) and (1,2) are already flagged as mines. This means that the remaining two neighboring cells, (1,3) and (2,1), must be safe.

    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (1,2) is numbered \"1\" and has one flagged cell adjacent to it at (2,1). This means that the remaining unopened cell adjacent to (1,2) at (2,2) must be safe to open. Additionally, the cell at (2,2) is numbered \"2\" and has two flagged cells adjacent to it at (3,1) and (3,2). This implies that the remaining unopened cell adjacent to (2,2) at (3,3) must also be safe to open. \n\nACTION: L(2,2)"

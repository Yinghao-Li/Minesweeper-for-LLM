The cells are presented as \"coordinate: state\" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by \"?\", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by \"1\" to \"8\", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by \".\", which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by \"F\", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to place a flag or a flagged cell (\"F\") to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (\"1\" to \"8\") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): .\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): ?\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): .\n(2,2): 1\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): .\n(3,2): 1\n(3,3): 2\n(3,4): 4\n(4,1): .\n(4,2): .\n(4,3): .\n(4,4): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number \"1\", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,4): .\n(1,5): 1\n(1,6): ?\n(1,7): ?\n(2,4): .\n(2,5): 1\n(2,6): F\n(2,7): ?\n(3,4): .\n(3,5): 1\n(3,6): 2\n(3,7): 4\n(4,4): .\n(4,5): .\n(4,6): .\n(4,7): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number \"1\", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with \"F\". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): 1\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): 2\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): ?\n(2,2): ?\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): ?\n(3,2): ?\n(3,3): ?\n(3,4): ?\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a \"1\", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: R(1,2) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 3]: ACTION: R(3,1) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 4]: ACTION: L(2,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell.

This means that there is one mine in the neighboring cells. The cell at (2,2) is numbered \"2\" and has two flags next to it at (1,2) and (3,1). This indicates that there are two mines in the neighboring cells. Since we have already flagged two cells, we can safely left-click on the cell at (2,3) to reveal it.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n\n",

    "REASONING: Since we are just starting the game, we have no information about the board. Therefore, any cell can potentially contain a mine. To minimize the risk, it is best to start by opening a cell that is surrounded by the most number of cells. The center cell at (3, 3) is surrounded by 8 cells, making it a good starting point.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is already opened and displays a \".\", indicating that it is a blank cell with no neighboring mines. This means that all of its adjacent cells are safe to open. Additionally, the cell at (2,2) is already opened and displays a \"2\", indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, three are already opened, leaving only one unopened cell at (1,2). Since there are two mines in the neighboring cells, it is logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (1,2) contains a mine. Therefore, our next move is to flag the cell at (1,2) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(1,2)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is currently unopened and has a blank tile. This means that there are no mines in its neighboring cells. Additionally, the cell at (3,2) is numbered \"1\", indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Out of the three neighboring cells, (2,2) and (4,2) are already opened, leaving only (3,1) unopened. Since there is only one mine, it is logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (3,1) contains the mine.\n\nACTION: R(3,1)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is already opened and displays the number \"2\". This means that out of its eight neighboring cells, two of them contain mines. We can also observe that the cell at (3,3) is opened and displays a \".\", indicating that it is a blank cell with no neighboring mines. Therefore, we can conclude that the two neighboring cells of (2,2) that contain mines must be (3,3) and one of the cells adjacent to (3,3). \n\nACTION: L(2,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is a numbered cell with a value of \".\", indicating that it has no neighboring mines. Additionally, the cells at (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4) are all numbered cells with a value of \"2\", indicating that each of them has two neighboring mines. Since the cell at (3,3) has no neighboring mines and the cells at (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4) already have two flagged cells adjacent to them, we can conclude that the remaining unopened cells adjacent to these numbered cells are safe to open.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered \"2\", indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,1), only (1,2) is flagged with an \"F\". This means that one of the remaining three cells contains a mine. Since (1,1) and (1,3) are both unopened, it is not possible to determine which one contains the mine. However, the cell at (2,3) is a blank cell, indicating that it has no neighboring mines. Therefore, it is safe to left-click on (2,3) to open it.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (2,2) is numbered \"2\", indicating that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Out of the four neighboring cells, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,1), only (1,2) is flagged with an \"F\". This means that one of the remaining three cells contains a mine. \n\nAdditionally, the cell at (3,2) is numbered \"1\", suggesting that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among the four neighboring cells, (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), and (3,1), only (2,1) is flagged with an \"F\". Therefore, we can deduce that one of the remaining three cells contains a mine.\n\nACTION: Based on the reasoning above, I will left-click on cell (1,1) to reveal its content.\n\nACTION: L(1,1)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (1,1) is numbered \"1\" and has a flag next to it. This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The cell at (2,2) is numbered \"2\" and has two flags next to it. This indicates that there are two mines in its neighboring cells. Since there are already two flags placed, we can safely conclude that the remaining neighboring cells of (2,2) are not mines. Therefore, we can left-click on the cell at (2,3) to reveal it.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (1,1) is numbered \"1\" and has a flag next to it at (1,2). This means that there is one mine in the neighboring cells. The cell at (2,2) is numbered \"2\" and has two flags next to it at (1,2) and (3,1). This indicates that there are two mines in the neighboring cells.

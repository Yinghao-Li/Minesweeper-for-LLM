  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as \"coordinate: state\" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by \"?\", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by \"1\" to \"8\", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by \".\", which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by \"F\", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (\"?\") to place a flag or a flagged cell (\"F\") to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (\"1\" to \"8\") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): .\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): ?\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): .\n(2,2): 1\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): .\n(3,2): 1\n(3,3): 2\n(3,4): 4\n(4,1): .\n(4,2): .\n(4,3): .\n(4,4): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number \"1\", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,4): .\n(1,5): 1\n(1,6): ?\n(1,7): ?\n(2,4): .\n(2,5): 1\n(2,6): F\n(2,7): ?\n(3,4): .\n(3,5): 1\n(3,6): 2\n(3,7): 4\n(4,4): .\n(4,5): .\n(4,6): .\n(4,7): 2\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number \"1\", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with \"F\". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n(1,1): 1\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): 2\n(1,4): ?\n(2,1): ?\n(2,2): ?\n(2,3): ?\n(2,4): ?\n(3,1): ?\n(3,2): ?\n(3,3): ?\n(3,4): ?\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a \"1\", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- YOUR ACTION HISTORY ---\n[Action 1]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 2]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 3]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 4]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 5]: ACTION: L(3,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 6]: ACTION: L(2,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 7]: ACTION: R(2,5) -> FEEDBACK: Action successful!\n[Action 8]: ACTION: L(2,4) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').\n[Action 9]: ACTION: R(2,3) -> FEEDBACK: Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\n\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n(1,1): .\n(1,2): .\n(1,3): 1\n(1,4): ?\n(1,5): ?\n(2,1): .\n(2,2): .\n(2,3): 1\n(2,4): 1\n(2,5): F\n(3,1): .\n(3,2): .\n(3,3): .\n(3,4): 1\n(3,5): ?\n(4,1): .\n(4,2): 1\n(4,3): 2\n(4,4): 3\n(4,5): ?\n(5,1): .\n(5,2): 1\n(5,3): ?\n(5,4): ?\n(5,5): ?\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section.

    "REASONING: Since we are just starting the game, we have no information about the board. Therefore, we can choose any cell to open. To have a good starting point, let's select the center cell at (3, 3). By opening this cell, we will reveal some information about its neighboring cells.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the current board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is still unopened and has a neighboring cell with the number \"1\". This indicates that there is one mine adjacent to (3,3). By examining the surrounding cells, we can see that (2,3) and (4,3) are already opened and do not contain any mines. Therefore, the unopened cell at (3,3) must be the location of the mine.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is currently blank, indicating that it has no neighboring mines. However, the cell at (3,4) displays the number \"1\", suggesting that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Since the cell at (3,3) is adjacent to (3,4), it is highly likely that (3,3) is also mine-free. Therefore, we can safely left-click on the cell at (3,3) to reveal its contents.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",

    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is currently blank, indicating that it has no neighboring mines. However, the cell at (3,4) displays the number \"1\", suggesting that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Since the cell at (3,3) is blank and has no mines nearby, it is safe to left-click on it to reveal its contents.\n\nACTION: L(3,3)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is currently blank, indicating that it has no neighboring mines. However, the cells surrounding it have numbers, suggesting that they have mines nearby. Since the cell at (2,3) has a number \"1\" and the cell at (3,4) has a number \"1\", it is likely that one of these cells contains a mine. To determine which one, we can examine the cell at (2,4). If it is a mine, then the cell at (3,4) must be safe. On the other hand, if the cell at (2,4) is safe, then the cell at (2,3) must be the mine. \n\nACTION: L(2,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (3,3) is a numbered cell with a \"1\". This means that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. We can also observe that the cells at (2,4) and (3,4) are both numbered cells with a \"1\". This indicates that there is one mine in their neighboring cells as well. Since the cell at (3,3) is already opened, we can deduce that the mine must be in one of the neighboring cells of (2,4) and (3,4). Therefore, the unopened cell at (2,5) is the most likely location for the mine.\n\nACTION: R(2,5)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (2,5) is flagged as a potential mine. This means that there is a mine adjacent to it. The cell at (2,4) is numbered as \"1\", indicating that there is one mine adjacent to it. Since the flagged cell at (2,5) is the only adjacent cell, we can deduce that it is the mine. Therefore, we can safely left-click on the cell at (2,4) to reveal it.\n\nACTION: L(2,4)",
    "REASONING: Looking at the board, we can see that the cell at (1,3) is numbered \"1\", indicating that there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, the cells at (2,3) and (2,4) are unopened. Since we already have a flag at (2,5), we can deduce that the mine is not in that cell. Therefore, the mine must be in either (2,3) or (2,4). \n\nACTION: R(2,3)"

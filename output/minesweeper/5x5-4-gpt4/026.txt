--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
"0","1","2","3","4"
"1",`.',`1',`?',`?'
"2",`.',`1',`?',`?'
"3",`.',`1',`2',`4'
"4",`.',`.',`.',`2'

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
"0","4","5","6","7"
"1",`.',`1',`?',`?'
"2",`.',`1',`F',`?'
"3",`.',`1',`2',`4'
"4",`.',`.',`.',`2'

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
"0","1","2","3","4"
"1",`1',`1',`2',`?'
"2",`?',`?',`?',`?'
"3",`?',`?',`?',`?'

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

>> ASSISTANT:

REASONING:
To start the game of Minesweeper, it's common practice to begin with a cell that is less likely to contain a mine. This is typically a corner or a central cell because these cells have fewer neighboring cells that could potentially be mines, which theoretically reduces the chance of hitting a mine on the first click. There is no information to work with yet, as no cells have been opened. Since the instructions specifically suggest beginning with the center cell at (3,3), this will be our starting action.

ACTION:
L(3,3)

REASONING:
The cell at (4,3) is a `1', meaning there is one mine in the neighboring cells. Since the cells at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), and (5,3) are already opened and not mines, the mine must be either at (4,1) or (5,2). However, the cell at (4,2) is also a `1' and since the cell at (3,1) is already opened and not a mine, the mine that (4,2) is indicating must be at (4,1). With this information, we can confidently place a flag on (4,1).

ACTION:
R(4,1)

REASONING:
The cell at (2,2) displays a `2', which means there are two mines in the neighboring cells. One mine is already flagged at (4,1). The other neighboring cells of (2,2) are either revealed or flagged, except for the cell at (1,1). Since there's only one other cell that can be a mine next to (2,2), we can deduce that the cell at (1,1) must contain the second mine. Therefore, we should flag this cell.

ACTION:
R(1,1)

REASONING:
The cell at (1,2) displays a `1', indicating there is one mine in the neighboring cells. Since the cell at (1,1) is already flagged as a mine, we can deduce that the other neighboring cells of (1,2) - which are (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) - do not contain mines. Therefore, it's safe to reveal the cell at (2,1).

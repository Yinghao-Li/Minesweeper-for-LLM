  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"4\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).\n\nREASONING:\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nStarting a game of Minesweeper typically involves opening a cell that does not border the edge of the board, as it will reveal the most information. The center cell is often a good choice because it is surrounded by eight other cells, which can potentially provide a lot of information about the location of mines. In this 5 by 5 Minesweeper game, the center cell is located at (3, 3). This cell is guaranteed to be safe in some versions of Minesweeper on the first click, but even if it's not, selecting the center cell is still a statistically sound strategy for the first move.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,3)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`1',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`2',`?'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nWith the current board, we can observe that the cell at (2,4) has the number '3', which indicates there are three mines in the surrounding eight cells. Looking at its neighbors, we can see that there are five cells around it that have been uncovered and are not mines. This leaves three cells that are still covered at (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5). Since this '3' has exactly three hidden neighboring cells, it's safe to assume that all three of these hidden cells must contain mines. Therefore, the logical action is to flag one of these cells as a mine. We can choose any of these cells, so let's proceed with the leftmost one at (1,3).\n\nACTION:\nR(1,3)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`F',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`1',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`2',`?'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nThe current board shows that the cell at (2,4) is a '3', meaning there are three mines in the surrounding eight cells. The cell at (1,3) has already been flagged as a mine (F). There are two remaining covered cells next to the '3' at (2,4), which are (1,4) and (1,5). Since the '3' cell must have exactly three mines around it and one has already been flagged, the other two must also be mines. Hence, we should flag either (1,4) or (1,5). To continue our systematic approach, we can flag the next cell in the sequence, which is (1,4).\n\nACTION:\nR(1,4)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`F',`F',`?'\n\"2\",`1',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`2',`?'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nLooking at the board, the cell at (2,4) is numbered '3', and we have already flagged two cells around it as mines (F), specifically at (1,3) and (1,4). There is only one other unopened cell adjacent to it, which is at (1,5). Since there must be exactly three mines around the '3' cell, and two have been flagged, the remaining covered cell at (1,5) must also contain a mine. We should flag this cell.\n\nACTION:\nR(1,5)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`F',`F',`F'\n\"2\",`1',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`2',`?'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nWith the current board, the cell at (3,4) is a '2', and there are two flagged cells adjacent to it at (1,3) and (1,4). This means the two mines that are adjacent to it have already been flagged. The only other unopened cell adjacent to it is at (2,5). Since the two mines that the '2' represents have been accounted for, the cell at (2,5) does not contain a mine and can be safely opened.\n\nACTION:\nL(2,5)\n\n\n>> USER:\nYour previous action \"L(2,5)\" is invalid.

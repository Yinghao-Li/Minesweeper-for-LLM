The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"4\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).\n\nREASONING:\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nAt the start of a Minesweeper game, there's no information that hints at where the mines are placed, as all the cells are unopened. A common strategy is to start from the center or corners where thereâ€™s potential to open up the largest area, as these cells have many adjacent cells. This can potentially reveal numbers to provide immediate information about where mines are. By opening a cell in the middle, we maximize the chances of not hitting a mine and potentially opening up a large section of the board. In this 5 by 5 board, the center cell is at (3, 3). Therefore, the logical first move is to open this central cell.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,3)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`?'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`?',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nWith the current board state, we have to look for cells that are guaranteed not to contain a mine based on the numbers shown. The cell at (4,1) shows `1', which means there's one mine in its neighboring cells. Since there's only one unopened cell next to it at (5,1), we can deduce that this is where the mine is located. Therefore, our next move should be to flag this cell to indicate a mine's presence.\n\nACTION:\nR(5,1)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`?'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nUpon examining the current board, we can see that the cell at (4,5) shows a `1', which means there is one mine in its neighboring cells. Since the cell at (3,5) is the only unopened neighboring cell and all the others are opened and not flagged, we can deduce that the unopened cell at (3,5) must contain a mine. Therefore, we should flag this cell.\n\nACTION:\nR(3,5)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`F'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nLooking at the board, the cell at (2,4) displays a `3', which indicates there are three mines in the adjacent cells. Two of these mines have already been flagged at (3,5) and (5,1). The only other unopened cells next to (2,4) are (1,3) and (1,4). This suggests that one of these two cells must contain the third mine. However, without additional information, we cannot determine which of the two cells contains the mine. \n\nIn search of a safe move, we observe the cell at (1,2) which displays a `1', indicating there is one mine in the neighboring cells. Since the mine has been flagged at (2,1), the other adjacent cells to (1,2) must be safe to open. Therefore, the cell at (1,3) is safe to reveal.\n\nACTION:\nL(1,3)\n\n\n>> USER:\nYour previous action \"L(1,3)\" is invalid. Error Message:\nGame over. Better luck next time!\nPlease follow the instructions and try again.\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`1',`3',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`1',`F'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`.',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n",

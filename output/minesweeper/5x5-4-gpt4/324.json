  "conversation": ">> SYSTEM:\nYou are a helpful assistant who is good at playing Minesweeper.\n\n>> USER:\n--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---\nIn Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"4\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).\n\nREASONING:\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nSince the Minesweeper board is entirely covered and we have no information to indicate where the mines might be, the first move is always a guess as there are no clues to work from. The center of the board is often chosen as the first move because if it's not a mine, it has the potential to reveal the most information. Opening a cell in the center maximizes the chance of hitting an empty cell or one that is adjacent to the fewest mines, thereby opening up the largest area and providing the most information to make subsequent decisions.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,3)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`1',`.'\n\"2\",`?',`3',`1',`1',`.'\n\"3\",`?',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`?',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"5\",`?',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nThe current board shows several numbers that can help us determine the next move. The `1' at the fifth row and second column (5,2) indicates that there is one mine in the adjacent unopened cells. Since all the other adjacent cells are already revealed, the mine must be in the cell at (5,1). We should flag this cell as it is definitely a mine.\n\nACTION:\nR(5,1)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`1',`.'\n\"2\",`?',`3',`1',`1',`.'\n\"3\",`?',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`?',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"5\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nThe number `2' at the fourth row and second column (4,2) indicates there are two mines in the neighboring cells. Since we've already flagged one mine at (5,1), there's only one unopened neighboring cell at (3,1), which must contain the second mine. Therefore, we should flag the cell at (3,1) as a mine.\n\nACTION:\nR(3,1)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`1',`.'\n\"2\",`?',`3',`1',`1',`.'\n\"3\",`F',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`?',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"5\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nLooking at the board, the `2' at the third row and second column (3,2) suggests there are two mines adjacent to it. We've already flagged one mine directly above it at (3,1). The only other unopened cell next to the `2' is at (4,1), which must therefore be the second mine. We should flag this cell.\n\nACTION:\nR(4,1)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`1',`.'\n\"2\",`?',`3',`1',`1',`.'\n\"3\",`F',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`F',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"5\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nThe `3' at the second row and second column (2,2) indicates there are three mines adjacent to it. Two of these mines have been flagged at (3,1) and (4,1). The only remaining unopened adjacent cell is at (1,2), which must contain the third mine. Therefore, we should place a flag on the cell at (1,2).\n\nACTION:\nR(1,2)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`F',`?',`1',`.'\n\"2\",`?',`3',`1',`1',`.'\n\"3\",`F',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`F',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"5\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nThe cell at (2,4) has a `1', and there is only one unopened cell next to it at (2,3) while all the others are either opened or flagged. Therefore, the unopened cell at (2,3) must contain a mine. We should flag this cell to indicate the presence of a mine.\n\nACTION:\nR(2,3)\n\n\n>> USER:\nYour previous action \"R(2,3)\" is invalid. Error Message:\nInvalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\nPlease follow the instructions and try again.\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`F',`?',`1',`.'\n\"2\",`?',`3',`1',`1',`.'\n\"3\",`F',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`F',`2',`.',`.',`.'\n\"5\",`F',`1',`.',`.',`.'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nI apologize for the mistake. Given the current state of the board, let's re-evaluate. On row 2, there is a `1' at (2,4) with one unopened cell next to it at (2,3). Since there's only one unopened cell adjacent to the `1', we can conclude that there must be a mine at (2,3). Since the action must be to flag an unopened cell, the correct action is to flag (2,3).\n\nACTION:\nF(2,3)\n\n\n",

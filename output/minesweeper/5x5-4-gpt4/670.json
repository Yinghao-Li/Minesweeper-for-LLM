The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:\n- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)\n- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)\n- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)\n- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)\n\nA player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.\n\n--- ACTION OPTIONS ---\nThere are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:\n\n- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.\n- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.\n- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.\n\n--- ACTION FORMAT ---\nEach of your actions should be formatted as \"A(row,col)\", where:\n- \"A\" represents the action type: \"L\" denotes a left-click, \"R\" indicates a right-click, and \"M\" signifies a middle-click.\n- \"row\" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.\n- \"col\" details the column number of the targeted cell.\nFor instance, an action like \"L(1,2)\" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\n--- EXAMPLES ---\nExample 1:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.\n\nACTION: R(2,3)\n\nExample 2:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\"\n\"1\",`.',`1',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`.',`1',`F',`?'\n\"3\",`.',`1',`2',`4'\n\"4\",`.',`.',`.',`2'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).\n\nACTION: M(1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nNotice that the board is displayed in partial.\n\n--- BOARD ---\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"\n\"1\",`1',`1',`2',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\nREASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.\n\nACTION: L(2,3)\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"2\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"3\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"4\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\n--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBegin by detailing your rationale in the \"REASONING\" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the \"ACTION\" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).\n\nREASONING:\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nTo start the game of Minesweeper, it's common to choose a cell that is centrally located, as this maximizes the chance of opening a large portion of the board and gives more information to make further deductions. The cell at (3,3) is right in the middle of the board, and since no information is yet known about where the mines are, it's statistically the best place to begin.\n\nACTION:\nL(3,3)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`?',`1',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`2',`2',`1',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`2',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nWith the current state of the board, there are several safe moves that can be made based on the information provided by the numbered cells. The cells along the edge that are showing a `1' next to a blank cell can be safely assumed to have a mine in the adjacent unopened cell. Specifically, the cell at (1,3) has only one adjacent unopened cell at (1,2), which must contain a mine. To progress in the game without risking opening a mine, we can flag the cell at (1,2) as it is the only unopened adjacent cell to (1,3).\n\nACTION:\nR(1,2)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`F',`1',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`2',`2',`1',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`2',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`?',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nThe cell at (4,1) is showing a `1', indicating there is one mine adjacent to it. Since the only unopened adjacent cell is at (5,1), we can deduce that the mine must be in that location. Therefore, we can safely flag cell (5,1) with a right-click.\n\nACTION:\nR(5,1)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`?',`F',`1',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`2',`2',`1',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`2',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`F',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nObserving the board, the cell at (2,1) shows a `2', indicating there are two mines adjacent to it. One mine is already flagged at (1,2). The only other unopened cell next to it is at (1,1), so we can conclude that the other mine must be at (1,1). Thus, the safe action is to flag cell (1,1).\n\nACTION:\nR(1,1)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`F',`F',`1',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`2',`2',`1',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`2',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`F',`?',`?',`?',`?'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nThe cell at (4,4) shows a `1', which means there is one mine adjacent to it. Since all surrounding cells are revealed except for the one at (5,4), we can deduce that (5,4) must contain the mine. We should therefore flag cell (5,4) with a right-click.\n\nACTION:\nR(5,4)\n\n\n>> USER:\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`F',`F',`1',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`2',`2',`1',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`2',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`F',`?',`?',`F',`?'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nLooking at cell (2,1), we can see it has a `2' which indicates there are two mines in the neighboring cells. Since one mine is already flagged at (1,1), the other mine must be in one of the unopened cells adjacent to (2,1). Cell (2,2) also has a `2', and given that there's already a mine flagged at (1,2), the second mine adjacent to (2,2) can only be at (3,1) because (3,2) is opened and cannot contain a mine. Thus, we can safely flag the cell at (3,1) as containing a mine.\n\nACTION:\nR(3,1)\n\n\n>> USER:\nYour previous action \"R(3,1)\" is invalid. Error Message:\nInvalid action: Cannot right-click a blank cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').\nPlease follow the instructions and try again.\n\n--- CURRENT BOARD ---\n```\n\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"\n\"1\",`F',`F',`1',`.',`.'\n\"2\",`2',`2',`1',`.',`.'\n\"3\",`.',`.',`.',`.',`.'\n\"4\",`1',`1',`2',`1',`1'\n\"5\",`F',`?',`?',`F',`?'\n```\n\nplease ensure:\n- You do not duplicate actions.\n- You submit only one action at a time.\n\nREASONING:\n\nACTION:\n\n\n>> ASSISTANT:\n\nREASONING:\nThe corrected action based on the previous reasoning should be to flag the cell at (3,1) as it is suspected to contain a mine. This is deduced from the fact that the '2' in both cells (2,1) and (2,2) must be satisfied by having two mines adjacent to them, and with the given flags and opened cells, the only possible location for the second mine around both of these cells is at (3,1).\n\nACTION:\nF(3,1)\n\n\n",

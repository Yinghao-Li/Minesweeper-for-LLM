--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The rows are seperated by newlines, and columns by commas. The board is structured as a 6 by 6 table, with the first row and column labeled using numbers in double quotation marks to indicate row and column indices. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by `?', which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by `1' to `8', which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by `.', which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by `F', which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell (`?') to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell (`?') to place a flag or a flagged cell (`F') to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell (`1' to `8') to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
"0","1","2","3","4"
"1",`.',`1',`?',`?'
"2",`.',`1',`?',`?'
"3",`.',`1',`2',`4'
"4",`.',`.',`.',`2'

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number `1', indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
"0","4","5","6","7"
"1",`.',`1',`?',`?'
"2",`.',`1',`F',`?'
"3",`.',`1',`2',`4'
"4",`.',`.',`.',`2'

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number `1', indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with `F'. This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
"0","1","2","3","4"
"1",`1',`1',`2',`?'
"2",`?',`?',`?',`?'
"3",`?',`?',`?',`?'

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a `1', suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

>> ASSISTANT:

REASONING:
To start the game of Minesweeper, it's common to choose a cell that has the least chance of being a mine. This is typically either a corner or a central cell because these positions potentially provide the most information when revealed. Given no other information at the beginning of the game, any unopened cell (`?') has an equal chance of being a mine. However, opening a central cell is generally the best strategy because it affects the most neighbors, allowing for more deductions after the first move. Therefore, the central cell at (3,3) is a strategic starting point.

ACTION:
L(3,3)

>> ASSISTANT:

REASONING:
Looking at the current board, we can see that some cells have been uncovered. The cell at (2,1) shows a `1', indicating there is one mine in the eight surrounding cells. Since all but one of these cells are already revealed and none are flagged as mines, the mine must be in the unopened cell at (3,1). Similarly, the cell at (4,2) also shows a `2', and there are two unopened cells adjacent to it ((3,1) and (5,1)), suggesting that both are mines. However, since we've already deduced that (3,1) contains a mine, we can conclude that (5,1) must also contain a mine. For our next move, we can flag the cell at (5,1) as a mine.

ACTION:
R(5,1)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:

REASONING:
The current board state reveals several cells around the flagged mine at (5,1). The cell at (2,1) shows a `1', which means there is only one mine in the adjacent cells. Since we have already flagged the cell at (5,1), we know that the other surrounding cells of (2,1) are safe. Specifically, the cell at (3,1) can now be safely opened. Similarly, the cell at (4,2) also shows a `2', and since we have flagged two cells adjacent to it as mines ((3,1) and (5,1)), we can deduce that the remaining adjacent cells to (4,2) are safe. Therefore, our next safe action is to open the cell at (3,1).

L(3,1)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:

REASONING:
The cell at (4,2) shows a number `2', which means there are two mines in the adjacent cells. One mine has already been flagged at (5,1). Among the unopened cells around (4,2), the only cells that have not been revealed yet are (3,1), (3,2), and (4,1). Since we cannot determine which of these contain the second mine without further information, it's not safe to open or flag any of these cells based on the current information around (4,2).

However, looking at the cell at (2,4), which has a `1', it indicates there is one mine in its adjacent cells. As all the adjacent cells to (2,4) are revealed except for (3,4), we can conclude that (3,4) does not have a mine. Therefore, it is safe to open (3,4).

ACTION:
L(3,4)

>> ASSISTANT:

REASONING:
Given the information on the board, the square at (4,2) has a '2' which means there are two mines adjacent to it. We have already flagged one mine at (5,1). The only unrevealed squares adjacent to (4,2) are (3,1), (3,2), and (4,1). Without additional information, we cannot determine the location of the second mine surrounding (4,2).

The square at (2,3) is also adjacent to two mines, but we only see one mine that is flagged at (1,2). Since the squares at (3,1) and (3,2) are the only unrevealed adjacent squares to (2,3), and we need to find one more mine for (4,2) and one more for (2,3), by logic, both of these squares must be mines. Therefore, we can safely flag both (3,1) and (3,2).

ACTION:
F(3,1)
